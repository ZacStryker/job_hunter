# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-project-scaffold-and-dev-prod-scripts (2026-03-28)

- `tsconfig.node.json` not referenced in main `tsconfig.json` via a `references` field. IDEs that only load the root `tsconfig.json` may show type errors on `vite.config.ts` and `drizzle.config.ts`. Not a build or runtime issue — the split config is functional. Consider adding `"references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]` and marking `tsconfig.node.json` with `"composite": true` in a future cleanup pass.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-database-schema-shared-types-and-boot-migrations (2026-03-28)

- `migrationsFolder` uses a CWD-relative path `'./src/db/migrations'` — breaks if process is not started from project root. Contrast with `src/index.ts` which already uses `import.meta.dir` for the dist path. Consider switching to `join(import.meta.dir, '../migrations')` in a future refactor. (By spec design for this story.)
- `runMigrations()` has no try/catch — a migration failure throws a raw unformatted exception that crashes the process. Consider wrapping in a try/catch with a structured error message before calling `process.exit(1)`. (By spec design for this story.)
- `DB_PATH` env var is used without validation — an invalid or malicious path is silently accepted. Will be addressed in Story 1.3 env validation.
- `recommendation` DB column is unconstrained `text` — the `['apply', 'investigate', 'skip']` enum is only enforced by Zod. Direct DB writes can store arbitrary values. SQLite has no native enum; could add a CHECK constraint in a future migration if stricter enforcement is needed.
- `company`/`jobTitle` in `jobInputSchema` accept empty strings (`z.string()` with no `.min(1)`). A blank-name row can be inserted and becomes a permanent block on future inserts with the same empty key. Add `.min(1)` if ingest issues arise.
- `company`/`jobTitle` uniqueness index is case-sensitive — `"Google"` and `"google"` are distinct rows. Normalization (lowercasing or collation) could be added in a future migration if duplicate detection issues arise.
- `db` SQLite singleton is never explicitly closed — on unclean process exit (SIGTERM, crash) the WAL file may not be fully flushed. Consider adding `process.on('exit', ...)` cleanup in a future story.
- Date fields (`dateScraped`, `coverLetterSentAt`, `dateApplied`) stored as raw `text` with no format enforcement beyond Zod `z.string()`. Non-ISO-8601 values can be inserted via direct DB access and will corrupt date-sorting/filtering. Add a Zod `.datetime()` or `.regex()` refinement in a future story if data integrity issues arise.
- `fitScore` has no DB-level CHECK constraint — values outside `[0, 100]` can be stored via direct DB writes. Consider adding `CHECK(fit_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100)` in a future migration.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-app-shell-environment-config-and-react-entry (2026-03-28)

- No `<React.Suspense>` boundary at app root (`src/client/main.tsx`) — if any future route uses `useSuspenseQuery` (TanStack Query v5 pattern), it will throw an unhandled suspension with no fallback UI. Add a Suspense boundary wrapping `RouterProvider` when adding data-fetching routes in Epic 3.
- `PORT` env var is validated for presence but not numeric validity — a non-numeric `PORT=abc` passes the env guard and causes `Number("abc")` → `NaN` at server startup, resulting in an unstructured uncaught exception rather than the clean env validation error. Pre-existing from Story 1.1; address in a future hardening pass.
- `migrate.ts` uses a CWD-relative `migrationsFolder: './src/db/migrations'` path — same issue as logged from Story 1.2 review. Pre-existing; not introduced by this story.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-1-api-ingest-endpoint-with-transactional-upsert (2026-03-29)

- TOCTOU: `existingKeys` pre-query in `api-ingest.ts` runs outside the transaction. A concurrent second request between the read and the transaction commit could make the add/update counts inaccurate. Non-issue for single-user localhost tool with no concurrent requests expected.
- `parsed.error.message` in Zod validation failures returns a JSON-stringified string (e.g., `"[{\"code\":\"invalid_type\"..."]`), not a clean human-readable message. Functional but ugly. Consider `parsed.error.issues.map(i => i.message).join(', ')` in a future polish pass.
- `company` and `jobTitle` accept empty strings — no `.min(1)` validation in `jobInputSchema`. Empty-key rows can be inserted and block future inserts with the same blank key. Pre-existing note from Story 1.2 review; add `.min(1)` if data quality issues arise from Sheets data.
- No payload size limit on `ingestPayloadSchema` — no `.max()` on the array. A very large batch could hold the SQLite write lock for an extended period. Non-issue for expected Sheets data volumes (~200 rows).
- `dateScraped` (and other date fields) accept any string format; no ISO-8601 validation. Pre-existing from Story 1.2 review.
